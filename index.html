<h1>RE: Eileen Dover University application</h1>
<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome Science Faculty to study as part of your next year PHD. I will answer your question one by one in the following section </p>
<h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>We are happy to accomodating your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you would start begining of a semester, the start date of each one are as follows: </p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>First Semester, 9 september 2016</li>

<p>you can find more information about <a href="https://example.com/" target="_blank">important University date</a> on our website</p>
<h2>Subject of study</h2>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility- as long as the subject fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>.Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3.)</sub></li>
        <li>. Mearsuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding <deg>30</deg>C(<deg>86</deg>F),when the audience size exponentially increase (effect of 3*10<sup>4</sup>increasing to 3*10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li>.HTML and CSS construct for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>so please can you provide more information on each of these subject, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dance. To answer your question, my favorite dance are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<p>Polymesian chicken dance</p>
<p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"</p>
<p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
<p>Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close togeter on the floor, and shuffling their bodie around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movement. One of my fellow student used to say he tought this dance inspired mordern styles such as Twerking.</p>
<p>Artic robot dance</p>
<p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explores in the 1960 belived to have discovered a new dance style charaterised by "robotic",stilted their bodies practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were cold.</p>
<p>For more of my research, see my <a href="https://example.com" target="">exotic dance research page.</a></p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
